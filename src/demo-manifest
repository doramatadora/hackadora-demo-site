This demo was created to push the boundaries of the platform and inspire new ideas!

## What's happening here?

Inference is where capabilities learned during deep learning training are put to work. 

This demo uses a [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/hosted_model) efficient convolutional neural network for mobile vision. We're using a pre-trained model for image classification - [MobileNet v2_1.4_224](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04381) - with a top-1 prediction accuracy of **74.9%** (top-5: 92.5%). Inference is handled entirely by a **single, originless** Compute@Edge service written in Rust ðŸ¦€. The code lives at [github.com/doramatadora/hackadora](https://github.com/doramatadora/hackadora).
