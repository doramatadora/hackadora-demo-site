## What's happening here?

This demo uses a [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/hosted_model) efficient convolutional neural network for mobile vision, MobileNet â€” variant [mobilenet_v1_0.50_224](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04861.pdf), with a top-1 prediction accuracy of **63.2%** (top-5: 84.9%) â€” for image classification. Inference is handled entirely by a **single, originless** Compute@Edge service written in Rust ðŸ¦€. The code lives at [github.com/doramatadora/hackadora](https://github.com/doramatadora/hackadora).
